# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game on AWS üöÄ‚òÅÔ∏è

In this tutorial, I will be deploying a Tic-Tac-Toe board game and host it on AWS. This game will be 100% serverless, benefiting from all the serverless services that are available on AWS such as Lambda Function, API Gateway. The game logic will be implemented using the popular AI Algorithm "MiniMax Algorithm" which is widely used in developing games.

# MiniMax Algorithm: üß†
--------------------------------------------------
The MiniMax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player zero-sum games, such as chess, checkers, or tic-tac-toe. Its main objective is to determine the optimal move for a player by considering all possible moves and their potential outcomes.

Here's a brief explanation of how the MiniMax algorithm works:

1) Tree Representation: The algorithm constructs a game tree where each level represents a player's turn, and each node represents a possible game state after a player's move.

2) Evaluation Function: At the leaf nodes (terminal states) of the tree, the algorithm evaluates the game state using an evaluation function. This function assigns a score to the state, indicating how favorable it is for the player whose turn it is.

3) Minimization and Maximization: The algorithm alternates between two types of nodes:

- Max Nodes: Represent the player's turn to maximize their score. The algorithm selects the move with the highest score.
- Min Nodes: Represent the opponent's turn to minimize the player's score. The algorithm selects the move with the lowest score.

4) Backtracking: The algorithm recursively explores the game tree until a certain depth or until reaching terminal states. Then, it backtracks, propagating the scores upward from the leaf nodes to the root of the tree.

5) Optimal Move Selection: Once the entire tree is evaluated, the algorithm selects the move that leads to the best outcome for the player, assuming the opponent also plays optimally.

Alpha-Beta Pruning (optional): To improve efficiency, an optimization technique called alpha-beta pruning can be applied to eliminate unnecessary branches of the tree, reducing the number of nodes that need to be evaluated.
