# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game on AWS üöÄ‚òÅÔ∏è

In this tutorial, I will be deploying a Tic-Tac-Toe board game and host it on AWS. This game will be 100% serverless, benefiting from all the serverless services that are available on AWS such as Lambda Function, API Gateway. The game logic will be implemented using the popular AI Algorithm "MiniMax Algorithm" which is widely used in developing games.
